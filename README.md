## Introduction
In the world of electronics, analog and integrated circuits play a crucial role. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to MOSFETs, BJTs, and op-amps, covering their principles, applications, and practical implementations.

## MOSFETs
- Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) are a type of transistor widely used for amplification and switching.They can be used as switches under the condition that $V<=V_{th}$ and as inverting amplifier when $V>V_{th}$.In the latter case **MOSFET** are commonly used as VCVS(Voltage controlled Votage sourse)
## BJTs
- Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) are another essential component in electronic circuits, offering unique characteristics.They are modelled as ICVS(Current controlled Voltage sourse)
## Operational Amplifiers
- Operational amplifiers, or op-amps, are versatile devices used in various applications such as amplification, filtering, and signal processing.They are versatile and can provide a linear amplification for a input voltage

## Installation
The repository also uses TINA as a circuit simulator with .tsc files
